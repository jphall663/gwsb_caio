## Basic Human AI Teaming Guidance

* **Don't let AI decide for you, instead ...**
  * Ask AI for options and you pick the best option combined with real-world knowledge.
  * Ask AI for feedback and improvements to your own ideas or decisions. 

* **Don't let AI answer a factual request for you, instead ...**
  * Search/research for the result yourself using a non-broken search engine (Kagi, Wayback Machine, Google Scholar) or libraries, books, indices, databases, or human experts.

* **Don't let AI write for you, instead ...**
  * You make the outline.
  * Ask AI to draft the outline into coherent text.
  * You proof and edit the result.
  * You add citations, figures, and tables, etc.

* **Don't trust AI to code for you, instead ...**
  * Have AI write the code and you write the tests and documentation OR ...
  * You write the code and have AI write the tests and documentation.

* **Understand when to use other types of AI ...**
  * Use statistics and ML for data analysis and direct decision-making.
  * Use real-time sensor networks for real-time info (maps, weather, etc.).
  * Use non-broken search for factual information retrieval (Kagi, Wayback Machine, Google Scholar).

* **Understand how AI fails you ...**
  * by hallucinating/making up information.
  * by generating fake citations.
  * by combining true information incorrectly.
  * by having poor knowledge in niche subjects.
  * by failing at complex reasoning tasks.

* **Understand how you fail with AI ...**
  * by allowing AI results to confirm your pre-existing biases.
  * by anthropomorphizing (ideas like "think," "understand," "reason," "feel" don't apply to AI ... AI systems memorize, calculate, and generate).
  * by anchoring to AI results because they are the first information you see.
  * by its sycophancy (allowing it to suck up to).
