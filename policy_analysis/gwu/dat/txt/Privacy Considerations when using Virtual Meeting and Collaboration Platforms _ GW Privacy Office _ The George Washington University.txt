Privacy Considerations when

using Virtual Meeting and

Collaboration Platforms

To ensure the protection of personally identifiable information and to meet privacy

regulations requirements, special care needs to be taken when using virtual meeting and

collaboration platforms (“virtual tools and technologies”).

The following guidance is offered to you by the GW Privacy Office, in Collaboration

with GW IT and it aims to assist in minimizing the risk of accidental personal

information disclosure, while using virtual tools and technologies.  

Faculty and Staff should only use virtual tools and technologies that have university

approved contracts, as they are privacy compliant (through appropriate privacy terms and

conditions) and configured with adequate security and privacy protections.  To protect

university non-public information, virtual tools and technologies should be integrated with

GW Single-Sign On or two-factor authentication, as well as have the capability for event-

specific password protection, encryption and attendance control.

In absence of a contract, virtual tools or technologies should not be used for any

university activity where non-public information will be shared.

Information on available university approved virtual tools and technologies can be found on

the GW IT Web Conferencing page. Additionally, virtual training and personalized guidance

on tools and best practices for virtual learning can be found on the Tools for Instructional

Continuity page.

Guidelines and Best Practices
To minimize risk of disclosure or breach of non-public data, these guidelines and best

practices apply to virtual tools and technologies for administrative operations and virtual

learning. Both the organizer (host) and participants should be aware of the privacy risks and

exposures that exist when facilitating and participating in online meetings using virtual tools

and technologies. 

Be familiar with configurations and settings that minimize privacy risks associated with the

use of virtual tools and technologies, such as the difference between public and non-public

virtual meeting rooms:

Non-Public Meeting Room: If the virtual event will contain content that is sensitive or

includes any personal identifiable information (PII or PHI), a non-public meeting room

should be used.  A non-public meeting room is one where a one-time password or

access code for entry into the meeting room is required; End to end encryption is

strongly recommended. All available encryption and privacy modes should always be

enabled. Do not record the virtual meeting unless it’s absolutely necessary (e.g. for

purposes of records retention or asynchronous learning.) If the meeting is recorded for

asynchronous learning purposes, the recording must not be shared outside of the class

roster without student consent.

Public Meeting Room: If the content will not include any personal identifiable

information (deidentified PII or PHI or general administrative or academic content), a

public meeting room can be used.  For example, a Webex personal room is a public

meeting room unless a password has been enabled. 

The following guidance applies to both non-public and public meeting rooms:

Use a 'green room' or 'waiting room' to allow the meeting to begin only after the host

joins.

Carefully control and monitor who has the ability to invite/share the meeting invite. For

example: avoid making the meeting available to anyone with the link.

Monitor attendees through a dashboard – identify all generic attendees before meeting

begins (e.g. Caller X).  The host should pay attention to all new/late arriving attendees

and ask them to identify themselves.  An unauthorized attendee should be expelled or

the meeting room may be locked once in progress to prohibit others from joining.

Before anyone shares their screen, files or other content, remind them not to share

sensitive or personally identifiable information during the meeting inadvertently. 

Online Classes

Instructors should be aware of the privacy risks and exposures that exist when hosting online

classes and lectures and maintain compliance with FERPA with regards to student's personal

information captured via virtual tools and technologies. 

Instructors should be familiar with configurations and settings that minimize privacy risks,

such as controlling attendance by not making the meeting available to anyone with the link. 

When the online class invite includes a virtual conference link, ensure students do not

forward the link to others not in the class, whether by mistake or otherwise.

Telehealth Activities

GW Clinics may seek to conduct telehealth activities.  When using virtual meeting

applications to provide telehealth services, all state licensing requirements and regulations

for health professionals must still be met. If virtual meeting applications will be used for

telehealth activities, non-public meeting rooms must be used. This requires the use of a one-

time password or access code for entry into the meeting room. End to end encryption is

strongly recommended. All available encryption and privacy settings should be enabled. 

Recordings

As a general rule, meetings, events, classes, lectures or health sessions should not be

recorded without a legitimate business purpose.  

Before recording a virtual meeting or event, you should notify attendees of your intent to

record. Provide attendees with details about why you want to record the meeting or event,

and ask their consent to the recording being used for that purpose. You may also consider

giving attendees the option to participate without having their image and/or voice recorded,

such as allowing them to attend with no video or audio, and the option to pose questions

only in the text chat window.

Zoom AI Companion

Zoom AI Companion is now available to all GW Staff and Faculty. Click here for instructions

on how to enable Zoom AI Companion for your university Zoom account.

Zoom AI Companion uses AI technology to allow meeting hosts to initiate an AI-generated

summary of their meetings and create smart recordings. 

The Zoom AI Companion Meeting Summary uses artificial intelligence to shorten

important meeting points into a brief summary. After the meeting, the host quickly gets an

email with a detailed summary, including Quick Recap, Summary, and Next Steps sections.

Zoom AI Smart Recordings extends the capabilities of Zoom AI Companion to cloud

recordings with transcripts. It enables meeting hosts to categorize their cloud recording into

segments known as smart chapters, while highlighting important information and next steps.
