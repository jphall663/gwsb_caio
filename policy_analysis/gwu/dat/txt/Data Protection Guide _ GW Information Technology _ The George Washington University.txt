Data Protection Guide

Protecting GW institutional data from unauthorized access or use is critical to maintaining the

confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all data stored, processed, printed, and/or

transmitted by faculty, staff and, where applicable, third parties. Throughout its lifecycle,

institutional data must be protected in a manner that is consistent with contractual or legal

requirements. Additionally, data protection measures must be reasonable and appropriate

for the classification level.  For example, a document that contains regulated and public

information must be managed and protected in accordance with requirements for regulated

information. 

This guide outlines data protection measures for GW Institutional data. When procuring

software or third-party services that will involve access to or use of institutional data, Faculty

and Staff are required to follow GW’s Procurement process to ensure compliance with GW

privacy and security protocols.

Physical security is the protection of personnel, hardware, software, networks, and data

from physical actions and events that could cause serious loss or damage to an institution.

When it comes to institutional data physical security controls, faculty and staff  should follow

the best practices below.

Restrict physical access to computers when you are away from your office or

workspace. For example, locking the door or using security cables or locking devices.

Secure access to computers and mobile devices by requiring passwords (except for

public computers with no Non-Public Information, such as those in the library or in

labs).  Passwords are integral to security. Follow the GW IT Identity and Access

Management Standard for selecting secure UserID passwords and how to reset them. 

Log out when finished using a GW system.

Secure access to your computers using a screen saver or built-in lock feature when you

are away from your office or work space.

Maintain possession or control of your mobile devices and apply appropriate

safeguards to the extent possible to reduce the risk of theft and unauthorized access.

In the event that a GW-owned computer or mobile device containing Non-Public

Information is lost or stolen, contact GW IT (incident@gwu.edu) immediately.
