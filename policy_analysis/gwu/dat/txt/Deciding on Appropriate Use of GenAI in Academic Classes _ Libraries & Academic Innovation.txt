Deciding on Appropriate Use of GenAI in

Academic Classes

Although GW has provided general guidance to faculty (see: George Washington University Guidelines for

Using GenerativeAI, Additional Guidance Regarding Generative Artificial Intelligence, and Educational Policy

and Technology Committee Guidelines for GAI in WID), faculty have flexibility in how and when they

encourage, allow, or prohibit students to use GenAI in their courses. The GenAI and Teaching Group (GAIT)

created these guidelines for faculty deciding on appropriate use of GenAI in academic classes. 

Developing a Policy That Will Work for Your Class and

Students

1. Review the costs and risks of GenAI use and factor these into your decision to encourage, allow, or

prohibit GenAI usage.

2. Consider ways GenAI use might facilitate or interfere with learning. This Expectations Worksheet

can help you think about different possible uses of GenAI. Be sure to consider:

Skill-based differentiation: Foundational courses might restrict GenAI to ensure basic skills are

developed. Advanced courses might incorporate GenAI as a professional tool.

Accessibility and equity: Some students may have better access to premium GenAI tools than

others, creating potential inequities.

While the library website is unaffected, the current Cloudflare outage may interrupt web access to some

software throughout the day. For example, the software used to schedule tutoring and review sessions

for Academic Commons (Penji) as well as other GWU sites and research databases may be intermittently

affected. Thanks for your patience as we wait for this issue to be resolved.

3. Ask ChatGPT, Claude, or another GenAI tool to complete current assignments. What did you want

students to learn from writing this assignment, and how might you ensure that learning if GenAI returns

high quality work? Consider how you will encourage academic integrity if you do not modify the

assignment. 

4. Discuss what you have learned with colleagues who teach similar courses to explore their

perspectives and approaches to the use of GenAI in academic classes.

5. Consider modifying assignments. Integrate GenAI in ways that support learning or make them resistant

to completion by existing GenAI tools.

6. Create policies. This tool can help you create a policy that will support your learning goals for students.

Plan for transparency: If GenAI is permitted, instruct students to document its use or reflect on how the use

impacted their learning.

7. Align policies with program/department goals. Consider how your course policies fit within broader

program or departmental learning objectives. Consider how your course can help students to improve

their GenAI literacy skills to succeed in your class, future classes, or their future profession.

8. Communicate policies. Review this guide to plan how to communicate your expectations with students.
