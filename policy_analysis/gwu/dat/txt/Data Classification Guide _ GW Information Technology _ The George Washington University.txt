Restricted and Public.

Classification

Level Description

Regulated Regulated data is information that is protected by local, national, or

international statute or regulation mandating certain restrictions.

Regulated information constitutes an area of critical concern because of

the severe risk to the university, its affiliates and to individuals, should

information be inappropriately accessed, altered, disclosed or

destroyed.

Regulated information requires strict control, very limited access and

disclosure, which may be subject to legal restrictions. Access to

regulated data must be limited to authorized university employees

(staff and faculty) with a valid business need. Where access to

regulated data has been authorized, use of such data shall be limited to

the purpose required to perform university business. Authorized users

must respect the confidentiality and privacy of individuals whose

regulated information they access, observe ethical restrictions that

apply to the information they access, and abide by applicable laws and

policies with respect to accessing, using, or disclosing information.

Examples of regulated data include:

Student academic and financial records, regulated by the

Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).

Government-issued identification numbers, including social

security numbers, driver license numbers, and passport

numbers.

Individuals' financial account numbers, including credit

card numbers and bank account numbers.

Data, information, or technical specifications not in the

public domain that are regulated by export control laws,

excluding technology or software that arises during, or

results from, fundamental research under Section 734.8 of

the Export Administration Regulations (EAR).

Data Owners in partnership with their appointed Data Stewards

 are responsible for implementing appropriate managerial,

operational, physical, and role-based controls. Consult with the

GW Data Governance team and GW Information Technology, for

guidance or questions regarding access to, use of, transmission of, and

disposal of Regulated Information (Data Protection Guide)

Restricted Restricted data is information that is not generally available to the

public, but deemed confidential due to university policies, contracts,

regulations or due to proprietary considerations.

Access to restricted data must be limited to appropriate university

faculty, staff, students, or other authorized users with a valid business

need. This information must be protected from unauthorized access,

use, or disclosure. If disclosed, altered or destroyed, restricted data

could cause a moderate adverse impact to the individual, university or

its affiliates.

Examples of restricted data include:

payroll and tax information, performance appraisals

legal records and contracts;

general ledger data, Facilities records

internal directory information

Level Description

redistributed by anyone with no existing local, national or international

legal restrictions on access or usage.

unauthorized modification or destruction. If altered or destroyed,

public data would cause little or no adverse impact to the university, its

affiliates, or the individual.

Example of public data include:

announcements and press releases

public event information

public directories and maps
