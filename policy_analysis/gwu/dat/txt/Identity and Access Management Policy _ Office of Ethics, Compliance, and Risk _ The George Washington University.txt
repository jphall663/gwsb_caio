Policy
 

Authorized Users shall be provided a unique identifier (e.g., GWID) at the point of joining the GW community. GW’s unique

identifier serves as a partial confirmation of an account owner’s identity and is part of the Authorized User’s Digital Identity.

The Authorized User’s Digital Identity will remain active until such time the user’s relationship with GW has concluded or

access to GW IT Resources is no longer required.

The process, procedures, roles, and responsibilities related to a Digital Identity are governed by the GW IT’s Identity and

Access Management Standards. Any requests and decisions related to accessing GW IT Resources via a Digital Identity shall

be made in accordance with the Identity and Access Management Standards, and the University Access to Accounts and

Electronic Information Policy.

All Authorized Users associated with GW are responsible for safeguarding their assigned Digital Identity from unauthorized

use by complying with the Acceptable Use of IT Resources Policy, Cybersecurity Risk Policy, and Identity and Access

Management Standards.

To mitigate the University’s cybersecurity risk, access to GW IT Resources shall be based on an Authorized User’s position or

function. Physical access to GW campus buildings and facilities are addressed in the Physical Access Policy.

Definitions
Authorized Users: All University students, faculty and staff. It also applies to all other individuals and entities granted use of

GW IT Resources, including, but not limited to, contractors, temporary employees, sponsored researchers, affiliates, visitors

and volunteers.

Digital Identity: A digital identity is associated to a unique identifier that is specific to each Authorized User who has an

active relationship with the University, and can consist of multiple unique attributes, accounts, credentials, and entitlements

associated with an individual.

GW Identification (GWID): A GWID is an alpha-numeric value used to identify an Authorized User within GW's

administrative systems and is required to access GW IT resources. A GWID is the letter G followed by an 8-digit number.

GW IT Resources: Any technology resource or equipment that supports one or more functional objectives of the university.

This includes any system, service or physical facility owned, contracted, or managed by the University to acquire, store,

process, transmit, scan, receive, or dispose of data or information (e.g., software, computers, mobile phones, tablets, storage

devices necessary for security and surveillance).
