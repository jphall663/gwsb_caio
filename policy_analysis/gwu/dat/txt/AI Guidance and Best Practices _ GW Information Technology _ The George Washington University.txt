AI Guidance and Best Practices

This administrative guidance directs GW staff and administrators on the responsible use and

procurement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and informs them about GW-approved

AI tools available for administrative functions. Guidance for AI in academic work is provided

separately in “GW’s Guidelines for Using Generative Artificial Intelligence in Academic

Work."

AI refers to computer systems designed to perform tasks that typically require human

intelligence. These systems use advanced analytical and logic-based techniques, including

Machine Learning (ML), to interpret patterns in large datasets, make predictions, and inform

actions. ML is a core AI component where systems learn from data to improve their

performance on specific tasks without being explicitly programmed for every scenario.

Generative AI is a specialized form of AI that can create new, original content such as text,

images, or code based on inferences drawn from existing information. Trained on vast

amounts of data, these tools (like chatbots and large language models) learn underlying

patterns to produce novel outputs in response to prompts. They can assist with

administrative tasks like drafting, summarizing, and organizing information, freeing up

human expertise for work requiring deeper insight and collaboration. Results of generative AI

should always be reviewed by humans for accuracy and context.

While generative AI is a popular example of AI, the principles outlined in this guidance apply

broadly to other AI applications used in administrative contexts, such as automation,

analytics, and predictive tools.

When used thoughtfully, AI can enhance productivity and support decision-making. When

used carelessly, it risks exposing sensitive data, introducing bias, or eroding institutional

trust. This guidance promotes appropriate, value-added AI use that reinforces professional

judgment and aligns with university policy.

This guidance aligns with GW's information technology, procurement, and privacy policies,

and its Code of Ethical Conduct.

Guiding Principles for Administrative Use of AI

 Use Only GW-Approved AI Tools

Use AI tools that have been reviewed and approved through GW’s procurement and risk review process. This pr

for ensuring security, compliance, and responsible AI use, especially when handling non-public information* to 

sensitive data.

For approved tools, always use your GW UserID to apply required security and data protections.

If unsure of a tool’s approval status, you must verify its approval by checking the Approved AI Tools List befo

ensure compliance and adherence to university

policy.

*Non-public information is data not publicly available. Examples include, but are not limited to: internal commu

student/employee data, unpublished research, drafts, and budget materials. With such data, even if anonymize

essential to prevent exposure of sensitive or identifiable details.

This guidance aligns with GW’s Cybersecurity Risk Policy, Identity and Access Management Policy and Acceptab

Resources Policy. 

 Protect GW Institutional Data and Personal Information

Be vigilant with data input into AI tools. All tools used must be GW-approved, but data suitability within these to

some types require more protection or are unsuitable for certain AI applications. To handle data appropriately w

First, determine the classification of your data. Review GW's Privacy Guidance for AI and Data Classification Gu

definitions and learn to identify:

Public Data: e.g., public website content, event information.

Restricted Data: e.g., non-public internal communications, plans, contracts – not for general public acce

Regulated data: e.g., legally protected data like FERPA/HIPAA records, government IDs – subject to spe

and representing the highest level of data sensitivity.

Once classified, ensure data is used only in GW-approved AI tools appropriate for its sensitivity level:

Public Data: May be used with any GW-approved AI tool, provided all other guidelines are followed.

Restricted Data: Must only be used in GW-approved AI tools specifically designated for handling this lev

sensitivity. Consult the Approved AI Tools List to verify a tool’s suitability for restricted data.

Regulated Data: Due to its extreme sensitivity and legal protections, regulated data may only be used in 

limited number of GW-approved AI tools explicitly certified by GW for this specific purpose. Extreme caut

required; always verify a tool’s certification for regulated data the Approved AI Tools List before any use.

Special Care for Personal Information (PII): This data, regardless of its primary

classification (which could be Restricted or Regulated), requires extreme caution. Use PII only if the AI too

approved for it and regulated data, and only if its use is absolutely essential and minimized.

Before using any data with AI, especially PII, carefully consider whether your objectives can be achieved withou

personal information, or if de-identified aggregate data would suffice. Remove any identifying details not strictl

for your task. For example, an AI analysis of support tickets can often be performed effectively without including

GW UserIDs or other PII.

This guidance aligns with GW's Privacy Guidance for use of Artificial Intelligence, Privacy of Personal Information

Protection Guide, and Cybersecurity Risk Policy.

AI tools can assist with tasks like brainstorming, summarizing, or drafting in your GW role, but they are designed

To do this effectively:

Critically Evaluate & Revise: Always treat AI-generated content as a first draft. Final decisions, interpreta

quality assurance must come from you. Verify its accuracy, originality, context, completeness, and tone usin

knowledge. Be aware that AI can produce errors or “hallucinations” and should never be accepted at face 

Thoroughly review and revise all output to ensure it aligns with GW’s data quality standards before use or s

the AI learned from, such as books, websites, or documents). Do not assume AI-generated content is clear

without careful review for potential infringement.

Identify and Mitigate Bias: Examine AI outputs for potential bias or discrimination. Apply objectivity and

perspective to avoid perpetuating harmful assumptions.

Maintain Final Oversight: Your decisions, interpretations, and quality assurance are paramount. You are 

for the final product.

 Practice Transparency

When you use AI to assist in creating content or deliver services, especially for materials or

interactions involving others, be clear about its involvement.

To practice transparency effectively:

Disclose AI Assistance in Content: When sharing content that has been AI-generated or significantly AI-a

provide a clear note about AI’s role.

Example: A simple statement such as, “Draft created with AI assistance and reviewed by [Your Name]”

sufficient.

Be Transparent About AI in Meetings and Collaboration: If AI tools are utilized during virtual meetings

collaborative sessions (e.g., for AI-powered transcription, summarization, or automated note-taking), revie

privacy considerations for virtual platforms. Ensure participants are appropriately notified to uphold transp

privacy standards.
