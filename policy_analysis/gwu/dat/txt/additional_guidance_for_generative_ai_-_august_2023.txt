Additional Guidance Regarding Generative Artificial 
Intelligence at the George Washington University

August 2023 

In spring 2023, the Office of the Provost distributed Guidelines for Using Generative Artificial 
Intelligence at GW. This document provides additional guidance to faculty at the beginning 
of the new academic year and highlights GAI-related resources available through the LAI 
Instructional Core. 

Help students understand the meaning of academic integrity as well as your 
expectations for written products 

• Reinforce what plagiarism/cheating is – why it’s wrong and your expectations for turning
in original work.

• Reference pertinent policies and ethics related to student conduct.

• Consider including a declaration of honesty in your assignments where students promise
to abide by the integrity standards you, the instructor, GW, and students expect of
themselves.

• Allow students to disclose, if the instructor permits the use of GAI, the use of GAI tools
like ChatGPT and GPT-3 and explain how it was useful in completing an assignment.

• Require at all levels meticulous citing of peer-reviewed and published work and identify
the reason for this.

• Consider allowing draft submissions prior to final submissions so that faculty and
instructional staff can get to know students’ writing voice and make targeted
recommendations for improvement, thus minimizing last-minute attempts at using
unauthorized tools.

• Plagiarism detection tools are available and should be used if you suspect a breach in
academic integrity.  SafeAssign is available to all GW instructors and can be found in the
Blackboard suite of tools.  Keep in mind that there are no tools that can reliably detect
GAI-generated text and that false positives may put you in a very difficult position with
students. 

• Be clear in your expectations and refer to learning objectives and grading rubrics or
criteria  when assessing a student’s work.

• When possible, ask students to present work they have done orally or in a public forum
like a class session.

Understand the limitations of GAI chatbots 

In understanding the behaviors and limitations of GAI tools outlined below, you can look more 
critically at student responses and better detect inappropriate use of GAI to generate work. 

• Chatbots can sometimes use verbiage repetitively or in unusual contexts.  Look for
phrases that were never used in the classroom but somehow find themselves in written
work by a student.

• Chatbots cannot create new ideas but only pull from the vast data sets that exist on the 
internet provided by others in digital formats.  Encourage creative and critical writing 
prompts in your assignments, asking students to perform more analysis and synthesis 
rather than repeat facts.  

• Chatbots do not cite their own writing and can generate false citations.  Require citations 
by students to ensure that peer-reviewed and published material from your course or 
elsewhere are supporting their thoughts.  Look for originality in writing. Spot-check cited 
materials to ensure that they exist. 

• Chatbots do not produce error-free content. Seek out inconsistencies and materials that 
do not adhere to course materials and adjacent assignments.  

• Chatbots do not produce contextually aware prose (especially for the casual user).  
Require students to write within context using real or even fictitious scenarios to ground 
their thinking.  

 
Final Thoughts and Additional Resources 
 
Remember, there is no failsafe method to prevent plagiarism.  However, you can use available 
tools to attempt to limit the use of GAI to take the place of original work.  Your human skills as 
instructors continue to be your best defense against dishonesty, and education about why 
integrity is important to the communication of knowledge is key.
