Technology Resources (“GW IT Resources”) to its community members to promote and advance

teaching, learning, and research, and to provide related administrative and operational support.

responsible manner. This policy establishes the acceptable use of GW IT Resources in furtherance

of its academic, research, and operational missions.

Resources shall be used in a manner consistent with applicable laws, regulations, university codes, and policies, as well as in

accordance with applicable contractual agreements, licenses, and terms of service.
