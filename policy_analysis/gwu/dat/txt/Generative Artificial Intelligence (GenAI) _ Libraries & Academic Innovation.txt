We recognize that GW faculty and students have a wide variety of views on generative AI (GenAI) tools. In the

Center for Teaching Excellence, our approach is to support faculty where they are. Regardless of whether you

choose to use GenAI in your teaching, we support you in identifying and using evidence-based strategies to

help support learning and academic integrity.

We continue to develop resources to support:

Discussing GenAI with your students from a variety of perspectives

Promoting learning without GenAI

Encouraging responsible use of GenAI if you permit students to use it

We recommend beginning with the following resources created by the GenAI and Teaching Group (GAIT)

and approved by the EPT subcommittee of the Faculty Senate:

Deciding on appropriate use of GenAI in academic classes

Communicating your GenAI expectations to students

Additionally, we offer multiple workshops each semester on teaching and GenAI, striving to provide a

balanced perspective. If you would like to invite us to your department, program, or other group for a tailored

workshop, please contact us.

Generative AI and Teaching Group (GAIT)

The Generative AI and Teaching Group (GAIT) brings together faculty from across GW to discuss the impact of

emerging GenAI capability on teaching and learning, explore institutional issues around pedagogy arising

While the library website is unaffected, the current Cloudflare outage may interrupt web access to some

software throughout the day. For example, the software used to schedule tutoring and review sessions

for Academic Commons (Penji) as well as other GWU sites and research databases may be intermittently

affected. Thanks for your patience as we wait for this issue to be resolved.
